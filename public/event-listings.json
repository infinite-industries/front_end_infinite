Carter’s figurative and abstract pieces reference the work of famed men, from Henri Rousseau and Henri Matisse, to Mark Rothko and Bill Cosby, employing savvy visual cues to examine the gendered imbalances that underlie their legacies.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>When dealing with the figure, Carter takes Rousseau’s and Matisse’s work as sources for her compositions. She stylistically appropriates their use of flat areas of vivid color and pattern, and the collapse of space in their depictions of hired models within carefully staged studios and “exotic” imaginary environments. Yet these settings completely give way to dream-like spaces where women are no longer passive decorative elements. Instead, Carter transforms archetypal images of odalisques, often exotified concubines or sex slaves, into images of powerful women. As chess masters, astronauts, and academic artist-fellows, or as small, rotund genderless figures that freely roam the canvas, all sharply gaze out at the viewer. In Carter’s representations, the one-sided power dynamic between artist and model dissolves through her literal repositioning of women in art.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>Playing with popular imagination, her non-figurative works call to mind the grandeur of the highly masculine Abstract Expressionist movement of the mid-1940s and ‘50s. ‘I’m an Oil Man’ prompts associations between the traditional use of oil paint by artists throughout art history, the cultural celebration of male genius-artists such as Mark Rothko and his color field paintings, and the wealth and prestige generated by both oil moguls and famous male artists who continually outsell and overshadow women artists working contemporaneously. In Carter’s ‘Cosby Sweater’ series, smeary, gestural lines and bold colors resemble the knit texture and ‘80s palette of Bill Cosby’s sweaters. The monumental works conflate the Abstract Expressionist qualities of strength, force, and virility with the allegations of sexual abuse committed by Cosby, provoking a sense of cognitive dissonance surrounding the cultural ties between masculinity and greatness.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>These images critique traditionally inadequate methods of art historicization and culturally sanctioned misogyny, both of which devalue the identities and contributions of women as artists, models, and human beings. As one of many groups previously left on the margins of critical and cultural conversation, Carter portrays women now in possession of their own image and at the center of their own experiences, revising the social dynamics and representational possibilities of the histories she engages with.</span></p>",

Over the last 10 years, EIT! has reinterpreted our shared memory into 3,000+ daily web videos, collected 15,000 Jerry Maguire VHS tapes, and forever altered the collective consciousness. Now, with their longtime collaborator Lucifer, Everything Is Terrible! has ingested over 2,000 satanic panic, religious kook, and D-horror VHS tapes. They have recontextualized them and created a narrative feature that reminds us all who we are, why we are here, and what we should be doing with our paltry time on this dumb planet. And now they invite you to be an initiate of the psychedelic devotion of EIT! As you take your blood oath, your journey will brim with evangelical ducks, goopy ghouls, and sad white men who believe that Dungeons & Dragons summon actual horned demons. Join your bedazzled Dadgods for an all-new live show, featuring never before seen puppets and costumes, as EIT! presents their newest feature, T H E G R E A T S A T A N.

He's doing it!!' Combining the dread and daring of a live video game speed run with the spot-on technique of a live band covering the musical accompaniment to everything you're seeing on-screen in real time, Bit Brigade will have you swinging between the two mediums. From thrashing about to live renditions of your favorite stage themes, fingers yearning to the sky in a rock 'n roll parody of sea anemones seeming to silently plead, 'Please, feed us more fretboard pyrotechnics!,' to being locked in stock-still rapture as the infallible maestro of the d-pad, Noah McCarthy, takes on the final boss and risks his video game life under the threat of intense peer scorn (or the reward of night-long glory and a credits score). No matter the outcome, Bit Brigade must play on until the deed is done - which it always is - on the first (and last) try. Once Noah’s NES buzzes on, there’s no turning back.' - Metalhead Mike of The Shizz, summer 2011</span></p>",
