By flipping the traditionally heteronormative male gaze of the female nude, Whitefox queers Southern male culture and its violent subtext of threatening dominance, penetration, power, identity, fear of self, and fear of others. Both anonymous and incredibly intimate, the models are often strangers to the artist. The amount of trust, vulnerability, but also joy and pleasure of exposing one’s own body is revealed and playfully voyeuristic. The back rooms and bathrooms of bars and restaurants are the settings for these images, providing the intense and messy tone of the working class service industry, of which the artist himself is an institutional part. These portraits reimagine the phallus as a symbol of protest against toxic masculinity and the religious and societal norms that restrict our definition of male identity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>Whitefox is a Lexington based multimedia artist and bartender.

He's doing it!!' Combining the dread and daring of a live video game speed run with the spot-on technique of a live band covering the musical accompaniment to everything you're seeing on-screen in real time, Bit Brigade will have you swinging between the two mediums. From thrashing about to live renditions of your favorite stage themes, fingers yearning to the sky in a rock 'n roll parody of sea anemones seeming to silently plead, 'Please, feed us more fretboard pyrotechnics!,' to being locked in stock-still rapture as the infallible maestro of the d-pad, Noah McCarthy, takes on the final boss and risks his video game life under the threat of intense peer scorn (or the reward of night-long glory and a credits score). No matter the outcome, Bit Brigade must play on until the deed is done - which it always is - on the first (and last) try. Once Noah’s NES buzzes on, there’s no turning back.' - Metalhead Mike of The Shizz, summer 2011</span></p>",
