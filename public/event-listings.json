Then, those stories became pieces that can allow others to be inspired and shaped.</p><p><br></p><p>The main goal of Inspiring &amp; Becoming is to bring young people into a position of leadership and empower them to ask questions of adults, explore questions of identity, and learn skills that will be useful in future learning and problem-solving through a creative, community- oriented art process.</p><p><br></p><p>This project was created in collaboration with The Open Forum Youth Initiative &amp; community artists, Ciara LeRoy, Stevie </p><p> Morrison, Paige Commodore, &amp; Felice Salmon. </p><p><br></p><p>The Open Forum Youth Initiative works with a group of young women aged 8-16 to develop and implement cultural and artistic initiatives of their design in Northeast Lexington. In an effort to allow youth to reach their full potential and learn to utilize their voices in community conversations in an equitable way, adult facilitators and co-mentors work alongside participants to teach youth to connect, contemplate, and create. </p><p><br></p><p>Leadership opportunities and creative problem-solving training are crucial to the wellbeing of young people and The Open Forum Youth Initiative would like to thank the Blue Grass Community Foundation &amp; the Kresge Foundation for supporting us in creating a safe space in which young women can access these resources</p>",

Her doctoral research focused on the use of food culture in feminist art in New York and California during the era of the “Second Wave.” Her more recent scholarship and curatorial work — which includes the exhibition New Domesticity concurrently at the Morlan Gallery and the Parachute Factory — has focused on contemporary women artists’ examination of craft and domestic labor in the American South. She is the author of a forthcoming article in the journal Performance Research and writes for various art publications including Number magazine and&nbsp;Hyperallergic.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=&#34;color: rgb(33, 33, 33);&#34;>Tiffany Calvert</strong></p><p><span style=&#34;color: rgb(33, 33, 33);&#34;>Tiffany Calvert's work has been exhibited in group and solo exhibitions including Lawrimore Project in Seattle, Visual Arts Gallery at SVA New York, and The Lab in San Francisco.

Potter’s music showcases limitless creativity and a vibrant sense of swing, prompting critics, musicians, and fans alike to cite him as the one of the finest saxophonists today. </p><p><br></p><p>The New Yorker calls Potter, “A tenorist who can remind you of Joe Henderson at his craftiest, he employs his considerable technique in the service of music rather than spectacle.” </p><p><br></p><p>Throughout his career, Potter has performed and recorded with artists as diverse as Steely Dan and Herbie Hancock, and has toured the world over with the Dave Holland Quintet, the Overtone Quartet, AZIZA, and the jazz-funk group, Chris Potter’s Underground. </p><p><br></p><p>The Dreamer is the Dream, by the Chris Potter Quartet, is the current chapter in Potter’s storied career.</p>",

Tickets are on sale at the Lyric Theatre box office: www.lexingtonlyric.tix.com and 859-280-2218. </p><p><br></p><p>The sold-out November 2017 show featured 35 Central Kentucky artists coming together in 13 acts to bring their considerable talent and respect to Cohen’s incomparable catalog. Two new performers will join the original artists in the reprise: 17-year old multi-instrumentalist and soulful vocalist, Daisy Helmuth, and Paul K, a staple of the Lexington blues and folk scene in the 90’s. </p><p><br></p><p>Original artists include One Lane Bridge, Colin Fleming, Paper Moon Trio, Quantum Mechanics, Four Leonards (and a Fifth), The Sherry Sebastian Trio, The Partisans, Doc Feldman with Art Shechet, The Joanna James Trio, Nevi’im, and Lauren Hill, Lorne Dechtenberg and Diane Arnson Svarlien.</p><p><br></p><p>“A startling Leonard Cohen Tribute…If there was a single concert event that underscored a sense of community this year it was the November summit honoring the songs of Leonard Cohen. There were wonderfully unspoiled and inventive interpretations of Cohen’s often prophetically poetic works that culminated with the artists and the audience singing ‘Hallelujah’ together…A rich and stylistically far-reaching overview.” -- Walter Tunis / Lexington Herald Leader</p><p><br></p><p>“For six decades, Leonard Cohen revealed his soul to the world through poetry and song—his deep time and timeless humanity touching our very core. Simply brilliant. His music and words will resonate forever.” –Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2008</p><p>Co-produced by the online cultural affairs publication UnderMain and Purple Carrots Productions.</p><p><br></p><p>Get your tickets early.
