Tickets are on sale at the Lyric Theatre box office: www.lexingtonlyric.tix.com and 859-280-2218. </p><p><br></p><p>The sold-out November 2017 show featured 35 Central Kentucky artists coming together in 13 acts to bring their considerable talent and respect to Cohen’s incomparable catalog. Two new performers will join the original artists in the reprise: 17-year old multi-instrumentalist and soulful vocalist, Daisy Helmuth, and Paul K, a staple of the Lexington blues and folk scene in the 90’s. </p><p><br></p><p>Original artists include One Lane Bridge, Colin Fleming, Paper Moon Trio, Quantum Mechanics, Four Leonards (and a Fifth), The Sherry Sebastian Trio, The Partisans, Doc Feldman with Art Shechet, The Joanna James Trio, Nevi’im, and Lauren Hill, Lorne Dechtenberg and Diane Arnson Svarlien.</p><p><br></p><p>“A startling Leonard Cohen Tribute…If there was a single concert event that underscored a sense of community this year it was the November summit honoring the songs of Leonard Cohen. There were wonderfully unspoiled and inventive interpretations of Cohen’s often prophetically poetic works that culminated with the artists and the audience singing ‘Hallelujah’ together…A rich and stylistically far-reaching overview.” -- Walter Tunis / Lexington Herald Leader</p><p><br></p><p>“For six decades, Leonard Cohen revealed his soul to the world through poetry and song—his deep time and timeless humanity touching our very core. Simply brilliant. His music and words will resonate forever.” –Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2008</p><p>Co-produced by the online cultural affairs publication UnderMain and Purple Carrots Productions.</p><p><br></p><p>Get your tickets early. The first show sold out quickly!</p>",
