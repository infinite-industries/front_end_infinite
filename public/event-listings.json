        "description":"<p>In 2012, Stuart Horodner wrote a book called The Art Life: On Creativity &amp; Career. He had the sense that the focus on “professional practices” as taught in art schools and university art departments was only one side of the story. Stuart had done plenty of lectures on this topic across North America, addressing how artists should approach galleries, what art magazines are good for, the best ways to visit fairs and festivals, and other strategic matters. As an ex-gallery owner and art fair organizer, he has a lot invested in clarifying misconceptions and trying to keep artists from being disappointed for the wrong reasons, as well as providing insights about positive aspects of their careers. </p><p><br></p><p>But much less often discussed is why people want to be artists at all, and how they sustain themselves in the process. Stuart's book is a kind of “self-help critical reader,” something that artists of all ages can use for a few nuggets of lived experience by emerging and well-known painters, filmmakers, designers, musicians, writers and dealers. </p><p><br></p><p>The discussion at Brier Books will address issues of creativity and career, community, and connectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>Stuart Horodner is Director of the UK Art Museum. He has been Artistic Director of the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; Curator at the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art in Oregon; Director of the Bucknell University Art Gallery in Pennsylvania; and was co-owner of the Horodner Romley Gallery in New York. He has contributed to journals and magazines, including Art Issues, Art Lies, Art on Paper, Bomb, Dazed &amp; Confused, Sculpture and Surface. He received his BFA from The Cooper Union, New York, NY, and his MFA from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.</p>",

FREE PARKING available in any E lot after 3:30 pm on Fridays.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan Estabrook employs nineteenth-century photographic techniques and visual tropes to create intimate images that are both deeply personal and universal: the pangs of falling in love, the fear of loss, taking an account of one’s life. Like his historic predecessors, Estabrook’s work veers between a guise of scientific inquiry and more symbolic and poetic interpretations. He often alters photographs— adding paint or emulsion to salt prints, or cutting away parts of tintypes— so that each work is unique.</p><p><br></p><p>Born and raised in Boston, Estabrook received a BA at Harvard and an MFA from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and now lives in New York.

I am concerned with the individual grandmothers in our society, after a whole life they are seen thru the lens of their role or perceptions of their archetype and vastly undervalued. When I ask people about their own grandmothers many confess they do not know her first name, how she grew up, nor her favorite music. Many people do not wonder about her until after she has passed. The absence in presence and presence in absence of this grandmother figure in the social lives of families, leads me to think about relationships, relationality and vulnerability in my work.</p><p><br></p><p>Goodwin received an MFA from Winthrop University and has shown work at the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center, McColl Center for Visual Art, Dimanche Rouge in Paris, 10/12 Gallery in Brussels, defibrillator gallery, SUPERNOVA, BIPAF and MPAB festivals and other venues. In addition, she serves as Director of Art Foundations at the University of Kentucky.</p>",
