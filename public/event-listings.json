Through examining both the known and unknown, the real and the romanticized, these artists offer insights into how we understand the notion of landscape and the world in which we live.</p><p><br></p><p>January 19:     gallery talks @ noon, with opening reception immediately following</p><p>Gallery Hop @ 5-8pm</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>under/currents</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://www.saritazaleha.com' target='_blank'>Sarita Zaleha</a></p><p><br></p><p>This project explores the interaction between the Arctic as a specific place impacted by rising temperatures and human attempts to observe, control, and preserve the environment. In <em>under/currents</em> visitors are drawn to aspects of experience that are often overlooked: movement in the air, alterations in smell, and the perception of time. The work endeavors to dig into certain layers of human experience of the environment through encouraging a hyperawareness of anxieties around climate change and attempts to self-soothe through encounters with the natural world. While attuning visitors to subtle sensory perceptions in their surroundings and simultaneously prompting them to think about a geographic area where some of the most dramatic of these changes are occurring, <em>under/currents</em> invites a tension between the immediacy of climate change and its accumulated effects.</p><p><br></p><p>Presented by Bolivar Art Gallery, this exhibition was created with support from Northern Lights.mn and the Jerome Foundation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Hushed Residuum</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://www.cutandtrace.com/' target='_blank'>Jennifer Anderson Printz</a></p><p><br></p><p>artist statement: There is something about me that makes me wonder about the imperceptible quality of stars in the noonday sun, what forces hold clouds up in the sky, and what arranges the sundry of the universe.&nbsp;This work is about the relationship of these and many other unknown things and a faith in their existence that is strong enough to try to visualize and recreate them. It is about working towards understanding in both a tangible physical way and a subtler spiritual one.</p><p>Through a progressive buildup of graphite or manual printing relief blocks, my hand asserts itself over photographs I have taken of the sky over my Southwestern Virginia home. The process is, to me, a loving process of focused attention and deliberate mark making as well as a meditative means of creating that reflects my visceral energies into the finished work through many hours of prolonged touch. The work then contains within it an intersection of humanity and nature, as well as a vast sense of intrinsic history.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://brooksdierdorff.com/' target='_blank'>Brooks Dierdorff</a></p><p><br></p><p>Landscapes have emotive power; moreover, they reflect and reverberate economic and cultural difference. Brooks Dierdorff examines the complexity of landscape in his series, <em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em>. He deconstructs imagery and material culture associated with the outdoors, from sunsets and leafy paradises to Styrofoam coolers and the eclectic office spaces of public park employees. Moreover, Dierdorff’s use of stock photography reinforces his interest in the ubiquitous subject matter of the often romanticized natural environment. The works belonging to <em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em> raise questions about how and why we represent nature in this age of Anthropocene. In his artist statement, Dierdorff writes, “The human impacts of this [Anthropocene] on the environment, and new relationships with the environment, are evident everywhere yet in many of our available models for visualizing and understanding them are very abstract.”&nbsp;While his work resonates with a multitude of meanings, the artist interrogates notions of respect and admiration for the natural world. As tangible organism and ubiquitous representation, nature is a part of our everyday lives and as a result we must ask: why don’t we treat it better?
