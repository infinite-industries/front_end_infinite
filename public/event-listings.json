The film, which was written and produced by Donna Ison, is a semi-autobiographical account of life in Lexington in the early nineties. It focuses on five fabulous friends who struggle to protect, serve, and entertain their favorite party girl as she searches for love, the meaning of life, and the perfect hooch recipe. </p><p><br></p><p>At its core, PASSIONFRUITS is a film about families of choice and the fortitude of friendship.

Through examining both the known and unknown, the real and the romanticized, these artists offer insights into how we understand the notion of landscape and the world in which we live.</p><p><br></p><p>January 19:     gallery talks @ noon, with opening reception immediately following</p><p>Gallery Hop @ 5-8pm</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>under/currents</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://www.saritazaleha.com' target='_blank'>Sarita Zaleha</a></p><p><br></p><p>This project explores the interaction between the Arctic as a specific place impacted by rising temperatures and human attempts to observe, control, and preserve the environment. In <em>under/currents</em> visitors are drawn to aspects of experience that are often overlooked: movement in the air, alterations in smell, and the perception of time. The work endeavors to dig into certain layers of human experience of the environment through encouraging a hyperawareness of anxieties around climate change and attempts to self-soothe through encounters with the natural world. While attuning visitors to subtle sensory perceptions in their surroundings and simultaneously prompting them to think about a geographic area where some of the most dramatic of these changes are occurring, <em>under/currents</em> invites a tension between the immediacy of climate change and its accumulated effects.</p><p><br></p><p>Presented by Bolivar Art Gallery, this exhibition was created with support from Northern Lights.mn and the Jerome Foundation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Hushed Residuum</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://www.cutandtrace.com/' target='_blank'>Jennifer Anderson Printz</a></p><p><br></p><p>artist statement: There is something about me that makes me wonder about the imperceptible quality of stars in the noonday sun, what forces hold clouds up in the sky, and what arranges the sundry of the universe.&nbsp;This work is about the relationship of these and many other unknown things and a faith in their existence that is strong enough to try to visualize and recreate them. It is about working towards understanding in both a tangible physical way and a subtler spiritual one.</p><p>Through a progressive buildup of graphite or manual printing relief blocks, my hand asserts itself over photographs I have taken of the sky over my Southwestern Virginia home. The process is, to me, a loving process of focused attention and deliberate mark making as well as a meditative means of creating that reflects my visceral energies into the finished work through many hours of prolonged touch. The work then contains within it an intersection of humanity and nature, as well as a vast sense of intrinsic history.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://brooksdierdorff.com/' target='_blank'>Brooks Dierdorff</a></p><p><br></p><p>Landscapes have emotive power; moreover, they reflect and reverberate economic and cultural difference. Brooks Dierdorff examines the complexity of landscape in his series, <em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em>. He deconstructs imagery and material culture associated with the outdoors, from sunsets and leafy paradises to Styrofoam coolers and the eclectic office spaces of public park employees. Moreover, Dierdorff’s use of stock photography reinforces his interest in the ubiquitous subject matter of the often romanticized natural environment. The works belonging to <em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em> raise questions about how and why we represent nature in this age of Anthropocene. In his artist statement, Dierdorff writes, “The human impacts of this [Anthropocene] on the environment, and new relationships with the environment, are evident everywhere yet in many of our available models for visualizing and understanding them are very abstract.”&nbsp;While his work resonates with a multitude of meanings, the artist interrogates notions of respect and admiration for the natural world. As tangible organism and ubiquitous representation, nature is a part of our everyday lives and as a result we must ask: why don’t we treat it better?

        "description":"<p>In 2012, Stuart Horodner wrote a book called The Art Life: On Creativity &amp; Career. He had the sense that the focus on “professional practices” as taught in art schools and university art departments was only one side of the story. Stuart had done plenty of lectures on this topic across North America, addressing how artists should approach galleries, what art magazines are good for, the best ways to visit fairs and festivals, and other strategic matters. As an ex-gallery owner and art fair organizer, he has a lot invested in clarifying misconceptions and trying to keep artists from being disappointed for the wrong reasons, as well as providing insights about positive aspects of their careers. </p><p><br></p><p>But much less often discussed is why people want to be artists at all, and how they sustain themselves in the process. Stuart's book is a kind of “self-help critical reader,” something that artists of all ages can use for a few nuggets of lived experience by emerging and well-known painters, filmmakers, designers, musicians, writers and dealers. </p><p><br></p><p>The discussion at Brier Books will address issues of creativity and career, community, and connectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>Stuart Horodner is Director of the UK Art Museum. He has been Artistic Director of the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; Curator at the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art in Oregon; Director of the Bucknell University Art Gallery in Pennsylvania; and was co-owner of the Horodner Romley Gallery in New York. He has contributed to journals and magazines, including Art Issues, Art Lies, Art on Paper, Bomb, Dazed &amp; Confused, Sculpture and Surface. He received his BFA from The Cooper Union, New York, NY, and his MFA from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Join me on a soundwalk of downtown Lexington! A soundwalk is a mindful walk with the intention of listening to the sounds all around you. We will move in a group, with our ears open, disconnected from our phones, and our speech hushed. </p><p><br></p><p>Following the walk, we will think and discuss ways in which the Lexington sounds mediate our daily lives as people, but also how these sounds may influence our lives as teachers, students, and political activists.</p><p><br></p><p>Schedule of events: </p><p>Arrive early - please meet in the lobby of the public library. </p><p>4pm: Walk begins (again, be early so you are not left behind)</p><p>4:50pm: Walk ends back at the library; a few minutes to use the bathroom and process. If you cannot stay for the second half of the event, this would be the time to leave as to not disturb the group. </p><p>5pm: Discussion and activities begin in Conference Room C. </p><p><br></p><p>In case of rain/snow, I will post a rescheduled date, otherwise we'll be walking in February weather! My hope is it will be a sunny (probably brisk) day, so please wear comfy shoes and appropriate attire. If you have any questions, please PM me!</p>",
