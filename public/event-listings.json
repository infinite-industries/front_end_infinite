         "description":"<p>Join us for a short film screening and pop-up show:</p><p><br></p><p>Inspiring &amp; Becoming is an unfolding conversation around the question, “Why does a person become who she is?” Built around a month-long investigation of personal &amp; historical stories of women, this project was led by a group of young people and community artists who worked together to examine the collective contributions of women to society and, then, portray them in creative ways.</p><p><br></p><p>They chose to interview, write, draw, stitch, reflect, video, paint &amp; photograph the stories of each other as a way of learning more about the thoughts, feelings &amp; strengths of womankind. Then, those stories became pieces that can allow others to be inspired and shaped.</p><p><br></p><p>The main goal of Inspiring &amp; Becoming is to bring young people into a position of leadership and empower them to ask questions of adults, explore questions of identity, and learn skills that will be useful in future learning and problem-solving through a creative, community- oriented art process.</p><p><br></p><p>This project was created in collaboration with The Open Forum Youth Initiative &amp; community artists, Ciara LeRoy, Stevie </p><p> Morrison, Paige Commodore, &amp; Felice Salmon. </p><p><br></p><p>The Open Forum Youth Initiative works with a group of young women aged 8-16 to develop and implement cultural and artistic initiatives of their design in Northeast Lexington. In an effort to allow youth to reach their full potential and learn to utilize their voices in community conversations in an equitable way, adult facilitators and co-mentors work alongside participants to teach youth to connect, contemplate, and create. </p><p><br></p><p>Leadership opportunities and creative problem-solving training are crucial to the wellbeing of young people and The Open Forum Youth Initiative would like to thank the Blue Grass Community Foundation &amp; the Kresge Foundation for supporting us in creating a safe space in which young women can access these resources</p>",

Two new performers will join the original artists in the reprise: 17-year old multi-instrumentalist and soulful vocalist, Daisy Helmuth, and Paul K, a staple of the Lexington blues and folk scene in the 90’s. </p><p><br></p><p>Original artists include One Lane Bridge, Colin Fleming, Paper Moon Trio, Quantum Mechanics, Four Leonards (and a Fifth), The Sherry Sebastian Trio, The Partisans, Doc Feldman with Art Shechet, The Joanna James Trio, Nevi’im, and Lauren Hill, Lorne Dechtenberg and Diane Arnson Svarlien.</p><p><br></p><p>“A startling Leonard Cohen Tribute…If there was a single concert event that underscored a sense of community this year it was the November summit honoring the songs of Leonard Cohen. There were wonderfully unspoiled and inventive interpretations of Cohen’s often prophetically poetic works that culminated with the artists and the audience singing ‘Hallelujah’ together…A rich and stylistically far-reaching overview.” -- Walter Tunis / Lexington Herald Leader</p><p><br></p><p>“For six decades, Leonard Cohen revealed his soul to the world through poetry and song—his deep time and timeless humanity touching our very core. Simply brilliant. His music and words will resonate forever.” –Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2008</p><p>Co-produced by the online cultural affairs publication UnderMain and Purple Carrots Productions.</p><p><br></p><p>Get your tickets early.
