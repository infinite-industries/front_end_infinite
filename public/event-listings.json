Using ecological sourced crushed silk, plastics, and repurposes objects, Chin weaves a narrative of the joys and losses that occur female-center communities.</p><p><br></p><p>Chin pulls in the vibrant colors and materials of Jamaica, where she was born. Raised by her grandmother and mother, she redefines motherhood as a state of continual intergenerational connection and interpersonal creation. Time is tracked in this state of being by sculptural representations of the stages of her mother’s illness. Diagnosed only 36 months before she died, Chin’s mother is the catalyst for the emotional rigor and upheaval expressed in her work, which culminates in a world of separation, grief, and ultimately, renewal and healing.</p>",

Two new performers will join the original artists in the reprise: 17-year old multi-instrumentalist and soulful vocalist, Daisy Helmuth, and Paul K, a staple of the Lexington blues and folk scene in the 90’s. </p><p><br></p><p>Original artists include One Lane Bridge, Colin Fleming, Paper Moon Trio, Quantum Mechanics, Four Leonards (and a Fifth), The Sherry Sebastian Trio, The Partisans, Doc Feldman with Art Shechet, The Joanna James Trio, Nevi’im, and Lauren Hill, Lorne Dechtenberg and Diane Arnson Svarlien.</p><p><br></p><p>“A startling Leonard Cohen Tribute…If there was a single concert event that underscored a sense of community this year it was the November summit honoring the songs of Leonard Cohen. There were wonderfully unspoiled and inventive interpretations of Cohen’s often prophetically poetic works that culminated with the artists and the audience singing ‘Hallelujah’ together…A rich and stylistically far-reaching overview.” -- Walter Tunis / Lexington Herald Leader</p><p><br></p><p>“For six decades, Leonard Cohen revealed his soul to the world through poetry and song—his deep time and timeless humanity touching our very core. Simply brilliant. His music and words will resonate forever.” –Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2008</p><p>Co-produced by the online cultural affairs publication UnderMain and Purple Carrots Productions.</p><p><br></p><p>Get your tickets early.
