Dan is&nbsp;the Great Meadows Foundation's&nbsp;inaugural&nbsp;Critic-in-Residence. During his March residency he&nbsp;has made studio visits to a number of artists in the region&nbsp;as part of the foundation's goal&nbsp;to help strengthen and support the critical growth of Kentucky artists’ work and their engagement with the larger art world.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=&#34;color: rgb(33, 33, 33);&#34;>Missions align as these three partners believe that exposure to criticism plays an essential part in an artist's&nbsp;development and a community’s growth.

He currently serves on the Advisory Boards of the Madison Park Art Conservancy in NYC and the ARC/Athens Artist Residency in Greece. He has received numerous awards for his curatorial and scholarly work, most recently the 2010 Service to the Arts Award by the Anderson Ranch in Aspen, Colorado, and the 2015 Eminent Scholar award from the American Cultural Association/Popular Culture Association.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=&#34;color: rgb(33, 33, 33);&#34;>Emily Elizabeth Goodman&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style=&#34;color: rgb(33, 33, 33);&#34;>Emily Elizabeth Goodman is a Lexington, KY-based art historian, curator and critic and Assistant Professor of Art History at Transylvania University.

Her doctoral research focused on the use of food culture in feminist art in New York and California during the era of the “Second Wave.” Her more recent scholarship and curatorial work — which includes the exhibition New Domesticity concurrently at the Morlan Gallery and the Parachute Factory — has focused on contemporary women artists’ examination of craft and domestic labor in the American South. She is the author of a forthcoming article in the journal Performance Research and writes for various art publications including Number magazine and&nbsp;Hyperallergic.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=&#34;color: rgb(33, 33, 33);&#34;>Tiffany Calvert</strong></p><p><span style=&#34;color: rgb(33, 33, 33);&#34;>Tiffany Calvert's work has been exhibited in group and solo exhibitions including Lawrimore Project in Seattle, Visual Arts Gallery at SVA New York, and The Lab in San Francisco.

Tickets are on sale at the Lyric Theatre box office: www.lexingtonlyric.tix.com and 859-280-2218. </p><p><br></p><p>The sold-out November 2017 show featured 35 Central Kentucky artists coming together in 13 acts to bring their considerable talent and respect to Cohen’s incomparable catalog. Two new performers will join the original artists in the reprise: 17-year old multi-instrumentalist and soulful vocalist, Daisy Helmuth, and Paul K, a staple of the Lexington blues and folk scene in the 90’s. </p><p><br></p><p>Original artists include One Lane Bridge, Colin Fleming, Paper Moon Trio, Quantum Mechanics, Four Leonards (and a Fifth), The Sherry Sebastian Trio, The Partisans, Doc Feldman with Art Shechet, The Joanna James Trio, Nevi’im, and Lauren Hill, Lorne Dechtenberg and Diane Arnson Svarlien.</p><p><br></p><p>“A startling Leonard Cohen Tribute…If there was a single concert event that underscored a sense of community this year it was the November summit honoring the songs of Leonard Cohen. There were wonderfully unspoiled and inventive interpretations of Cohen’s often prophetically poetic works that culminated with the artists and the audience singing ‘Hallelujah’ together…A rich and stylistically far-reaching overview.” -- Walter Tunis / Lexington Herald Leader</p><p><br></p><p>“For six decades, Leonard Cohen revealed his soul to the world through poetry and song—his deep time and timeless humanity touching our very core. Simply brilliant. His music and words will resonate forever.” –Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2008</p><p>Co-produced by the online cultural affairs publication UnderMain and Purple Carrots Productions.</p><p><br></p><p>Get your tickets early. The first show sold out quickly!</p>",
