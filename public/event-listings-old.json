She is touring this fall with her band, The Filthy Unbelievers, in support of her new EP “Ambition,” a song cycle based on Macbeth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>R.

For nearly four decades he has been a restless explorer of sound, and maker of music that literally and figuratively falls between the cracks. From a crash course of learning the guitar in the post-punk era to live sampling performances and generative sound installations concerning concepts of spatiality and hypnagogia. Since the late nineties, he is best known for developing a highly idiosyncratic language on the metal bodied resonator guitar, extending its timbral and harmonic range far outside the usual role in bluegrass or blues.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>CONCETTA ABBATE</span></p><p><a href='https://www.concettaabbate.com/' target='_blank' style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(54, 88, 153);'>https://www.concettaabbate.com/</a></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>'Like many violinists, Concetta Abbate is classically trained, just as likely to be found playing Ravel or Paganini as she is her own music. She finds inspiration in poetry, literature and scientific observation. The point of the “pocket-sized songs” on her loosely thematic new debut album, Falling in Time (streaming at Bandcamp) is that despite how distracted we are by the demands of dayjobs, family and (yuck) technology and social media, we mustn’t cut ourselves off from the world around us because it’s so interesting.... Abbate finds meaning and beauty in the seemingly mundane, translating that tersely and imagistically into a series of brief, often barely two-minute songs that could be called chamber pop or art-rock but really defy categorization.' --Lucid Culture</span></p>",

Over the last 10 years, EIT! has reinterpreted our shared memory into 3,000+ daily web videos, collected 15,000 Jerry Maguire VHS tapes, and forever altered the collective consciousness. Now, with their longtime collaborator Lucifer, Everything Is Terrible! has ingested over 2,000 satanic panic, religious kook, and D-horror VHS tapes. They have recontextualized them and created a narrative feature that reminds us all who we are, why we are here, and what we should be doing with our paltry time on this dumb planet. And now they invite you to be an initiate of the psychedelic devotion of EIT! As you take your blood oath, your journey will brim with evangelical ducks, goopy ghouls, and sad white men who believe that Dungeons & Dragons summon actual horned demons. Join your bedazzled Dadgods for an all-new live show, featuring never before seen puppets and costumes, as EIT! presents their newest feature, T H E G R E A T S A T A N.

And no, going to a Gwar show with a white t-shirt on doesn't count. When Bit Brigade takes the stage your mind will frantically oscillate between 'Oh! Agh!! Please don't die!!' and 'YES! He's doing it!!' Combining the dread and daring of a live video game speed run with the spot-on technique of a live band covering the musical accompaniment to everything you're seeing on-screen in real time, Bit Brigade will have you swinging between the two mediums. From thrashing about to live renditions of your favorite stage themes, fingers yearning to the sky in a rock 'n roll parody of sea anemones seeming to silently plead, 'Please, feed us more fretboard pyrotechnics!,' to being locked in stock-still rapture as the infallible maestro of the d-pad, Noah McCarthy, takes on the final boss and risks his video game life under the threat of intense peer scorn (or the reward of night-long glory and a credits score). No matter the outcome, Bit Brigade must play on until the deed is done - which it always is - on the first (and last) try. Once Noah’s NES buzzes on, there’s no turning back.' - Metalhead Mike of The Shizz, summer 2011</span></p>",

Carter’s figurative and abstract pieces reference the work of famed men, from Henri Rousseau and Henri Matisse, to Mark Rothko and Bill Cosby, employing savvy visual cues to examine the gendered imbalances that underlie their legacies.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>When dealing with the figure, Carter takes Rousseau’s and Matisse’s work as sources for her compositions. She stylistically appropriates their use of flat areas of vivid color and pattern, and the collapse of space in their depictions of hired models within carefully staged studios and “exotic” imaginary environments. Yet these settings completely give way to dream-like spaces where women are no longer passive decorative elements. Instead, Carter transforms archetypal images of odalisques, often exotified concubines or sex slaves, into images of powerful women. As chess masters, astronauts, and academic artist-fellows, or as small, rotund genderless figures that freely roam the canvas, all sharply gaze out at the viewer. In Carter’s representations, the one-sided power dynamic between artist and model dissolves through her literal repositioning of women in art.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>Playing with popular imagination, her non-figurative works call to mind the grandeur of the highly masculine Abstract Expressionist movement of the mid-1940s and ‘50s. ‘I’m an Oil Man’ prompts associations between the traditional use of oil paint by artists throughout art history, the cultural celebration of male genius-artists such as Mark Rothko and his color field paintings, and the wealth and prestige generated by both oil moguls and famous male artists who continually outsell and overshadow women artists working contemporaneously. In Carter’s ‘Cosby Sweater’ series, smeary, gestural lines and bold colors resemble the knit texture and ‘80s palette of Bill Cosby’s sweaters. The monumental works conflate the Abstract Expressionist qualities of strength, force, and virility with the allegations of sexual abuse committed by Cosby, provoking a sense of cognitive dissonance surrounding the cultural ties between masculinity and greatness.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>These images critique traditionally inadequate methods of art historicization and culturally sanctioned misogyny, both of which devalue the identities and contributions of women as artists, models, and human beings. As one of many groups previously left on the margins of critical and cultural conversation, Carter portrays women now in possession of their own image and at the center of their own experiences, revising the social dynamics and representational possibilities of the histories she engages with.</span></p>",

Columbus, GA, 1983) makes objects that blur defined borders between painting and sculpture, art and craft, questioning the necessity of such distinctions. Her current work exists in two separate but related modes; modestly-sized brightly painted three-dimensional wall works, and large, bold, patterned ‘tapetes’, or rugs, woven from Clippinger’s gouache drawings. Fittingly, she shares a hometown and draws inspiration from two figures who operate similarly: Eddie Owens Martin and Alma Thomas. Both artists are known for working in saturated color, meticulous pattern, and for creating work that supersedes those same boundaries.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>At first glance, Clippinger’s work fits neatly within a lineage of artists working in abstraction within the last century. Her found-object assemblages bear no small resemblance to work by Betty Parsons (1900 -1982), perhaps better known as a legendary gallerist and advocate for abstract expressionists before the movement was well-received critically. The ‘tapetes’ can be seen as related to weavings by artist and textile designer Sophie Taeuber-Arp (1889 - 1943) who also challenged arbitrary divisions between art and craft and championed the use of materials and techniques that had not been used in fine art contexts previously. These artists, of course, are understood as figures situated firmly within the Western art canon and the movements they helped to establish. As is often the case, in the process of their historicization, the non-western aesthetic practices from which they frequently drew inspiration were often forgotten or ignored.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>Clippinger’s work, however, is remarkably cognizant of the universal context from which it arises. This is especially true for the tapetes. Abstract graphic adornment of objects, frequently utilitarian ones, is a phenomenon that exists across most of human history and in nearly all cultures; the decorated ‘parfleches’ made by indigenous Americans, abstract tantric paintings from Rajasthan, Australian aboriginal sand painting, and quilts from Gee’s Bend, Alabama, are just a few examples. Clippinger began painting the gouache studies for the tapetes while living in Oaxaca, Mexico. In the weaving village of Teotitlan del Valle, she met a family of rug weavers and approached them about translating her drawings into the tapetes. Since 2014, she has worked with Licha Gonzalez Ruiz and Agustín Contreras Lopez to create the woven works. The process is collaborative, and authorship is shared; rather than asking the couple to alter their wool dyeing process to accurately match her colors, Clippinger uses the gouache drawings as a jumping off point, frequently developing new palettes in response to the colors at hand.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>In this body of work especially, the divisions that have been put in place to keep art and craft separate are rendered moot, and the impetus for the establishment of those divisions is laid bare. Frequently the distinction between what constitutes art and craft is determined along lines of gender, race, class, and geography. The work of artists is differentially privileged, legitimized, and valued according to these hierarchies. Clippinger, in recognizing this and making work that actively flattens some of those differences, does important work in undoing the structures that maintain such a system, and does so with levity, humor, and brightness.</span></p>",

A vulnerable and powerful exploration of emotional narratives, Trouble Anyway showcases her background in diverse musical styles from free improv, garage rock, country, pop, to folk-infused song-craft. Following up her 2016 debut Out of Love (Siltbreeze), named one of the top 100 records of 2016 by Uncut Magazine, Trouble Anyway is a cohesive collection of lush, intimate rock songs, featuring her warm, natural vocals and powerful riffing and rhythm guitar, approaching the sublime when Rosali finds expression beyond lyricism, utilizing her voice as a human instrument.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href='https://rosalimusic.com' target='_blank' style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(54, 88, 153);'>https://rosalimusic.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>Josh Mason (Jacksonville, FL)</span></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>Josh Mason lives and works in Jacksonville, FL.

By flipping the traditionally heteronormative male gaze of the female nude, Whitefox queers Southern male culture and its violent subtext of threatening dominance, penetration, power, identity, fear of self, and fear of others. Both anonymous and incredibly intimate, the models are often strangers to the artist. The amount of trust, vulnerability, but also joy and pleasure of exposing one’s own body is revealed and playfully voyeuristic. The back rooms and bathrooms of bars and restaurants are the settings for these images, providing the intense and messy tone of the working class service industry, of which the artist himself is an institutional part. These portraits reimagine the phallus as a symbol of protest against toxic masculinity and the religious and societal norms that restrict our definition of male identity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(29, 33, 41);'>Whitefox is a Lexington based multimedia artist and bartender.

Karl Blau toured Europe, specifically the UK, extensively in 2016 and 17 and by contrast you could see him at Anacortes Farmer's Market playing for folks there in his home town.

By flipping the traditionally heteronormative male gaze of the female nude, Whitefox queers Southern male culture and its violent subtext of threatening dominance, penetration, power, identity, fear of self, and fear of others. Both anonymous and incredibly intimate, the models are often strangers to the artist. The amount of trust, vulnerability, but also joy and pleasure of exposing one’s own body is revealed and playfully voyeuristic. The back rooms and bathrooms of bars and restaurants are the settings for these images, providing the intense and messy tone of the working class service industry, of which the artist himself is an institutional part.

         "description":"<p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(75, 79, 86);'>'PASAQUOYANISM IS THE NEXT THING, MAN, IT IS DEFINITELY WAITING IN THE WINGS!!! It means the end of all these Buddhists and Muslims and Christians and all this other shit, man. I just hope I live long enough to establish it.'</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(75, 79, 86);'>Eddie Owens Martin (1908 - 1986), better known as St. EOM, founded his own religion, Pasaquoyanism, in response to visions he had that started in his early twenties. In them, he was visited by giant men with long beards parted down the middle and hair that stood straight up from their heads. They instructed him to build Pasaquan, an expansive compound in his hometown of Buena Vista, Georgia, on which he built pagodas, temples, shrines, and dance floors made of cement and sand lavishly decorated with bright patterns and bas-relief, vividly painted representations of the beings that would continue to visit him over the course of his life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(75, 79, 86);'>Martin left Georgia at the age of 14, hitching his way North to New York City. He spent the next three decades there, working as a hustler and tea room clairvoyant. For several years, he ran a gambling den and sold Georgia-style fried chicken and hand-rolled marijuana cigarettes out of his apartment in Harlem. In 1942, the operation was busted, and he was sent to the Federal Narcotics Prison Hospital (known colloquially as the Narco Farm) in Lexington, Kentucky, where he and most of the inmates, by most accounts, enjoyed themselves thoroughly. The friendships made while he was in the area would later lead a number of Lexingtonians, among them Robert Morgan and Guy Mendes, to make pilgrimages to Pasaquan in the 70s and 80s.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(75, 79, 86);'>Martin returned to New York in 1943, and, when not reading tea leaves or waiting tables at the Howdy Club, a popular gay nightlife spot at the time, painted constantly. Frequently too poor to afford paper or canvas, Martin often made use of scrap wood and metal as a painting surface. The work from this period mirrors the style and subject that would later come to define the murals and totems of Pasaquan. From an interview with Tom Patterson in 1983:&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(75, 79, 86);'>“I was paintin’ like mad in those days,” he recalled. “I’d go to work in the tea room from 3:00 to 10:00, then I’d get back home and light up a joint or two and go to work on the paintin’ I had on the wall. I was paintin’ scenes of ancient Mayan temples and some of the other ancient civilizations, and some pictures of the heads with the upswept hair. All kinda things—beautiful paintin’s. I tried to get some of my art in the galleries in New York, but I just couldn’t ever get through. It was just … Well, it just wasn’t like the average art. It was too bizarre for ’em.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(75, 79, 86);'>In the mid-1950’s, another vision instructed Martin to go home to rural Georgia and begin work on Pasaquan, which he would build and maintain throughout the rest of his life. St. EOM pulled from myriad sources that span time, geography, and culture to build the system of beliefs on which his art and life’s work was founded. Pasaquoyanism, although it is a cult of one, continues to draw interest by examining thoroughly the roots and intricacies of so many systems of situating oneself within the spiritual world, and in that pursuit finds elements that are genuine and common to all of them.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(75, 79, 86);'>This collection is made available by the courtesy of Columbus State University, Columbus State University Foundation, Inc., Pasaquan in Buena Vista, Georgia, and through a gift by the Kohler Foundation, Inc.

Tickets are on sale at the Lyric Theatre box office: www.lexingtonlyric.tix.com and 859-280-2218. </p><p><br></p><p>The sold-out November 2017 show featured 35 Central Kentucky artists coming together in 13 acts to bring their considerable talent and respect to Cohen’s incomparable catalog. Two new performers will join the original artists in the reprise: 17-year old multi-instrumentalist and soulful vocalist, Daisy Helmuth, and Paul K, a staple of the Lexington blues and folk scene in the 90’s. </p><p><br></p><p>Original artists include One Lane Bridge, Colin Fleming, Paper Moon Trio, Quantum Mechanics, Four Leonards (and a Fifth), The Sherry Sebastian Trio, The Partisans, Doc Feldman with Art Shechet, The Joanna James Trio, Nevi’im, and Lauren Hill, Lorne Dechtenberg and Diane Arnson Svarlien.</p><p><br></p><p>“A startling Leonard Cohen Tribute…If there was a single concert event that underscored a sense of community this year it was the November summit honoring the songs of Leonard Cohen. There were wonderfully unspoiled and inventive interpretations of Cohen’s often prophetically poetic works that culminated with the artists and the audience singing ‘Hallelujah’ together…A rich and stylistically far-reaching overview.” -- Walter Tunis / Lexington Herald Leader</p><p><br></p><p>“For six decades, Leonard Cohen revealed his soul to the world through poetry and song—his deep time and timeless humanity touching our very core. Simply brilliant. His music and words will resonate forever.” –Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2008</p><p>Co-produced by the online cultural affairs publication UnderMain and Purple Carrots Productions.</p><p><br></p><p>Get your tickets early.

Cheryl is a twenty-something black lesbian working as a clerk in a video store while struggling to make a documentary about Fae Richards, an obscure black actress from the 1930's. Cheryl is surprised to discover that Richards (known popularly as 'the Watermelon Woman') had a white lesbian lover. At the same time, Cheryl falls in love with a very cute white customer at the video store (Guinevere Turner from GO FISH). Such are the complexities of race and sex in this startlingly fresh debut, which has been attacked by conservative Congressmen for having been funded by the NEA and lavishingly praised in the editorial pages for being charming and courageous.</span></p>",

In Weedeater, the reader finds Canard County living through the last hurrah of the coal industry and the most turbulent and deadly phase of the community’s battle with opioid abuse. The events it chronicles are frantic, but its voice is by turns taciturn and angry, filled with humor and stoic grace.</p>",

Then, those stories became pieces that can allow others to be inspired and shaped.</p><p><br></p><p>The main goal of Inspiring &amp; Becoming is to bring young people into a position of leadership and empower them to ask questions of adults, explore questions of identity, and learn skills that will be useful in future learning and problem-solving through a creative, community- oriented art process.</p><p><br></p><p>This project was created in collaboration with The Open Forum Youth Initiative &amp; community artists, Ciara LeRoy, Stevie </p><p> Morrison, Paige Commodore, &amp; Felice Salmon. </p><p><br></p><p>The Open Forum Youth Initiative works with a group of young women aged 8-16 to develop and implement cultural and artistic initiatives of their design in Northeast Lexington.

      "description":"<p>When we first talked with Raleigh Dailey about being part of the series, we asked him if there was a show that he had been waiting for the opportunity to present. He immediately mentioned Bob Belden's vivid re-imagination of Giacomo Puccini's masterwork, Turandot. </p><p><br></p><p>After years of exploring Belden's sketches, Raleigh has re-worked Turandot for a septet featuring trumpet, reeds, trombone, guitar, keyboards, bass and drums. The result is an ethereal jazz landscape filled with the textures and melodies of modern Jazz. This work brings to mind Miles Davis' In a Silent Way and classic ECM records. </p><p><br></p><p>This piece has only been performed a handful of times worldwide since it was first released in 1992, and we are excited to present our first programmatic show, especially one that features a heavy emphasis on arranging and orchestration. </p><p><br></p><p>OJS Presents: Raleigh Dailey will feature Sam Flowers (trumpet), Douglas Drewek (reeds), Brad Kerns (trombone), Ross Whitaker (guitar), Eli Uttal-Veroff (bass), and Paul Deatherage(drums) alongside Raleigh. </p><p><br></p><p>After what feels like a long layoff, we are only 10 days out! make sure to buy your tickets now, as we've sold out for the last two shows. Tickets are available through up top. </p><p><br></p><p>—-</p><p><br></p><p>Raleigh Dailey is an internationally recognized jazz pianist, composer, scholar, and educator. He studied at Kent State University (B.M, 1991), the University of North Texas (M.M., 1996), and the University of Kentucky (Ph.D., 2007). Dailey has performed widely throughout the United States, North and South America, Europe, and Asia. In 2002 he was selected to perform at the 3rd Annual International Martial Solal Jazz Piano Competition in Paris, France.</p><p><br></p><p>Dailey is in high demand as a composer and arranger; his works have been performed and recorded by numerous college, university, military, and professional jazz ensembles. His most recent chamber works are the Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano and Conversations for Trombone and Piano. He also was the recipient of the Al Smith Fellowship for Musical Composition sponsored by the Kentucky Arts Council. He has published articles in IAJE Research Papers, The Encyclopedia of Appalachia, Saxophone Journal, Jazz Improv Magazine, Music Reference Services Quarterly, Notes, and Teaching Music Through Performance In Jazz.</p>",

    "description":"<p>Artist Rae Goodwin performs &#34;some-please-screaming-sugar,&#34; as part of her work currently on display in the New Domesticity: Women's Work in Women's Art exhibition.</p><p>Rae Goodwin writes about her work, &#34;In my art practice I am concerned with maternal ancestry as it influences the construction of identity, assumptions of strength and notions of agency. I am concerned with the individual grandmothers in our society, after a whole life they are seen thru the lens of their role or perceptions of their archetype and vastly undervalued. When I ask people about their own grandmothers many confess they do not know her first name, how she grew up, nor her favorite music. Many people do not wonder about her until after she has passed. The absence in presence and presence in absence of this grandmother figure in the social lives of families, leads me to think about relationships, relationality and vulnerability in my work.</p><p><br></p><p>Goodwin received an MFA from Winthrop University and has shown work at the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center, McColl Center for Visual Art, Dimanche Rouge in Paris, 10/12 Gallery in Brussels, defibrillator gallery, SUPERNOVA, BIPAF and MPAB festivals and other venues. In addition, she serves as Director of Art Foundations at the University of Kentucky.</p>",

    "description":"<p>In 2012, Stuart Horodner wrote a book called The Art Life: On Creativity &amp; Career. He had the sense that the focus on “professional practices” as taught in art schools and university art departments was only one side of the story. Stuart had done plenty of lectures on this topic across North America, addressing how artists should approach galleries, what art magazines are good for, the best ways to visit fairs and festivals, and other strategic matters. As an ex-gallery owner and art fair organizer, he has a lot invested in clarifying misconceptions and trying to keep artists from being disappointed for the wrong reasons, as well as providing insights about positive aspects of their careers. </p><p><br></p><p>But much less often discussed is why people want to be artists at all, and how they sustain themselves in the process. Stuart's book is a kind of “self-help critical reader,” something that artists of all ages can use for a few nuggets of lived experience by emerging and well-known painters, filmmakers, designers, musicians, writers and dealers. </p><p><br></p><p>The discussion at Brier Books will address issues of creativity and career, community, and connectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>Stuart Horodner is Director of the UK Art Museum. He has been Artistic Director of the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; Curator at the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art in Oregon; Director of the Bucknell University Art Gallery in Pennsylvania; and was co-owner of the Horodner Romley Gallery in New York. He has contributed to journals and magazines, including Art Issues, Art Lies, Art on Paper, Bomb, Dazed &amp; Confused, Sculpture and Surface. He received his BFA from The Cooper Union, New York, NY, and his MFA from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.</p>",

    "description":"<p>NEW LOCATION: Singletary Center for the Arts, Recital Hall. (405 Rose Street) Event is open to the public and FREE. FREE PARKING available in any E lot after 3:30 pm on Fridays.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan Estabrook employs nineteenth-century photographic techniques and visual tropes to create intimate images that are both deeply personal and universal: the pangs of falling in love, the fear of loss, taking an account of one’s life. Like his historic predecessors, Estabrook’s work veers between a guise of scientific inquiry and more symbolic and poetic interpretations. He often alters photographs— adding paint or emulsion to salt prints, or cutting away parts of tintypes— so that each work is unique.</p><p><br></p><p>Born and raised in Boston, Estabrook received a BA at Harvard and an MFA from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and now lives in New York. He has exhibited widely and received grants and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Peter S. Reed Foundation Grant and the Buhl Foundation, among others.</p><p>image: DAN ESTABROOK, Little Devils, no 6, 2002, calotype negative with pencil, and salt print. Courtesy of the artist.</p>",

    "description":"<p>WRFL proudly presents Sissy-Spacek with Robert Beatty and local opener, Daryl Cook. Come out for an evening of music that truly blurs the line between sound and art. Lexington local Daryl Cook starts the night with his own brand of confounding and fragile improvised electronic music. Afterwards, Sissy-Spacek takes the stage with local artist Robert Beatty (Hair Police, Resonant Hole). Together, this ensemble is set to fill the building with an electro-acoustic arrangement of experimental sounds. </p><p>--</p><p>Sissy-SpaceK: https://sissyspacek.bandcamp.com/</p><p>Robert Beatty: http://www.robertbeattyart.com</p><p>Daryl Cook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-LCMfNC9I</p>",

Through examining both the known and unknown, the real and the romanticized, these artists offer insights into how we understand the notion of landscape and the world in which we live.</p><p><br></p><p>January 19:     gallery talks @ noon, with opening reception immediately following</p><p>Gallery Hop @ 5-8pm</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>under/currents</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://www.saritazaleha.com' target='_blank'>Sarita Zaleha</a></p><p><br></p><p>This project explores the interaction between the Arctic as a specific place impacted by rising temperatures and human attempts to observe, control, and preserve the environment. In <em>under/currents</em> visitors are drawn to aspects of experience that are often overlooked: movement in the air, alterations in smell, and the perception of time. The work endeavors to dig into certain layers of human experience of the environment through encouraging a hyperawareness of anxieties around climate change and attempts to self-soothe through encounters with the natural world. While attuning visitors to subtle sensory perceptions in their surroundings and simultaneously prompting them to think about a geographic area where some of the most dramatic of these changes are occurring, <em>under/currents</em> invites a tension between the immediacy of climate change and its accumulated effects.</p><p><br></p><p>Presented by Bolivar Art Gallery, this exhibition was created with support from Northern Lights.mn and the Jerome Foundation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Hushed Residuum</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://www.cutandtrace.com/' target='_blank'>Jennifer Anderson Printz</a></p><p><br></p><p>artist statement: There is something about me that makes me wonder about the imperceptible quality of stars in the noonday sun, what forces hold clouds up in the sky, and what arranges the sundry of the universe.&nbsp;This work is about the relationship of these and many other unknown things and a faith in their existence that is strong enough to try to visualize and recreate them. It is about working towards understanding in both a tangible physical way and a subtler spiritual one.</p><p>Through a progressive buildup of graphite or manual printing relief blocks, my hand asserts itself over photographs I have taken of the sky over my Southwestern Virginia home. The process is, to me, a loving process of focused attention and deliberate mark making as well as a meditative means of creating that reflects my visceral energies into the finished work through many hours of prolonged touch. The work then contains within it an intersection of humanity and nature, as well as a vast sense of intrinsic history.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em></strong></p><p><a href='http://brooksdierdorff.com/' target='_blank'>Brooks Dierdorff</a></p><p><br></p><p>Landscapes have emotive power; moreover, they reflect and reverberate economic and cultural difference. Brooks Dierdorff examines the complexity of landscape in his series, <em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em>. He deconstructs imagery and material culture associated with the outdoors, from sunsets and leafy paradises to Styrofoam coolers and the eclectic office spaces of public park employees. Moreover, Dierdorff’s use of stock photography reinforces his interest in the ubiquitous subject matter of the often romanticized natural environment. The works belonging to <em>The Soft Wreckage of Paradise</em> raise questions about how and why we represent nature in this age of Anthropocene. In his artist statement, Dierdorff writes, “The human impacts of this [Anthropocene] on the environment, and new relationships with the environment, are evident everywhere yet in many of our available models for visualizing and understanding them are very abstract.”&nbsp;While his work resonates with a multitude of meanings, the artist interrogates notions of respect and admiration for the natural world. As tangible organism and ubiquitous representation, nature is a part of our everyday lives and as a result we must ask: why don’t we treat it better?

    "description":"<p>Edward Melcarth: Rough Trade </p><p>January 13 - February 10</p><p><br></p><p>Opening Reception: Saturday, January 13 6 - 8 PM</p><p><br></p><p>Edward Melcarth (1914 - 1972, born Louisville, Kentucky) was an American painter known primarily for his sensitive, emotional, and often heroic portrayal of the male figure. Melcarth’s subjects were blue collar workers, hustlers, addicts, and trade with whom he had intimate relationships. These men also frequently make appearances in work by other gay artists who were living and working in New York at the same time, namely Henry Faulkner of Lexington, Kentucky, and photographer and archivist Thomas Painter. Despite showing widely and prominently in the 1940’s (his work is included in the collections of MOMA, the Smithsonian, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art) Melcarth has since faded into relative obscurity.</p><p><br></p><p>Melcarth’s portrayal of working class and otherwise down and out men who read as straight, and often defined themselves as such despite having sex with other men, and his often glorified or romantic treatment of their image, served dual function in the historical context of their making. For straight viewers of the work, the paintings become quintessential images of the American workforce where grit, brute strength, and the ability to wade through difficulty, especially economic, is rewarded and mythologized. For gay men, and for Melcarth himself, the images served as a vehicle to examine socially unacceptable desire in relative safety. For both groups, a one way mirror is constructed, allowing for a selective understanding of the work, dependent on point of view.</p><p><br></p><p>However, Melcarth was uniquely situated and deeply conscious of these perspectives. He was a militant communist with radical views on how the working class should be organized and treated, as well as a largely out-of-the-closet homosexual, and was closely monitored by the FBI as a result of both. As noted in Erin Griffey and Barry Reay’s article about the artist, entitled, ‘Sexual Portraits: Edward Melcarth and Homoeroticism in Modern American Art,’ Thomas Painter speculates that Melcarth's lack of relative commercial and critical success compared to similar artists working concurrently was largely due to his Jewish background, militant communism, and open homosexuality. </p><p><br></p><p>Despite this, Melcarth remains an influential and foundational figure in early twentieth century gay American art. A reconsideration of his work, legacy, and contributions are long overdue, and the themes explored in his work remain pertinent to contemporary concerns. </p><p><br></p><p>All artworks courtesy of the Forbes Collection, New York, on loan to the Faulkner Morgan Pagan Babies Archive.

     "description":"<p>“The writing of Kelly Luce is beautifully stark and simple, and at the same time playful, earthy, and violent. She’s unique, a natural born writer, and Pull Me Under is a strange and very appealing novel, a journey to Japan and the primal scene of the main character's self―which, like a volcano, may have already blown its top.” ―Rachel Kushner</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;Kelly Luce's unforgettable debut is an elegant mystery, a tender story of family and forgiveness, an unsettling depiction of the darkness we each carry inside, and a hymn to Japan. Noodle shops, summer festivals, ancient temples, and the lush landscape of rural Shikoku burst to life in these pages. From its first sentence, Pull Me Under grabs the reader and doesn't let go.&#34; ―Sarah Bird, author of Above the East China Sea</p><p><br></p><p>“As Rio moves deeper into the painful secrets of the past, secrets that nearly destroyed her in childhood and are threatening to undo her once again, I could not stop turning the pages of Kelly Luce’s hypnotic debut. Pull Me Under is a fierce and suspenseful exploration of the profoundly mysterious nature of identity, written with precise and spectacular beauty. Kelly Luce is one of our most thrilling new talents.” ―Laura van den Berg</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;Kelly Luce’s debut novel is an urgent and wise story about the many disparate identities a life can hold, but it is also an astonishing example of all that a novel can encompass. By turns, Pull Me Under is a finely crafted mystery, a portrait of a fractured family, an evocative travelogue, an aching coming-of-age tale, and an insightful contemplation of our inescapable histories in an increasingly globalized and digitized culture. In this novel, Luce offers many poignant, page-turning pleasures, but her greatest gift to the reader is her revelation of how a single life, a single mind, a single, artful book can contain multitudes.&#34; ―Stefan Merrill Block</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;This is a suspense novel with a female protagonist that gets more right about women than so many others I've read in the past few years.&#34; ―NPR</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;Revelatory&#34; ―Elle</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;[Pull Me Under] will bewitch you.&#34; ―O Magazine</p>",

     "description":"<p>Performance artist, playwright, and fashion designer Stephen Varble (b. Owensboro, Kentucky, 1946; d. New York City, 1984) was a fixture on the streets of SoHo in the 1970s, but his ephemeral practice has largely gone unrecognized in histories of art. His guerrilla practice aimed at disruption — of commerce, of gender roles, and of the institutions of art and celebrity. In elaborate sculptural garments made of street trash, Varble held unauthorized gallery tours through SoHo and protest performances in banks, Fifth Avenue stores, and in the street. A favourite of photographers such as Greg Day, Peter Hujar, and Jimmy DeSana, Varble’s art performed gender transformation and hybridity for both popular and art audiences in the 1970s. Over the past five years, David Getsy has been recovering, through interviews and private archives, the story of Varble’s work from his early performances as a student at the University of Kentucky to his participation in Fluxus and Warhol’s Factory to his unique brand of street performance to his work in video art. He will discuss Varble’s work and the struggle to write the first history of this performance artist who left little behind and who was antagonistic to art’s institutions.</p><p><br></p><p>David Getsy is the Goldabelle McComb Finn Distinguished Professor of Art History at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His books include Abstract Bodies: Sixties Sculpture in the Expanded Field of Gender (2015); Scott Burton: Collected Writings on Art and Performance, 1965-1975 (2012); Rodin: Sex and the Making of Modern Sculpture (2010); and, most recently, the collection of artists’ writings, Queer, for the Whitechapel Gallery’s ‘Documents of Contemporary Art’ book series (2016). His current major projects focus on archival-based recoveries of queer and genderqueer performance art in the 1970s.</p>",

    "description": "Join us as we salute the musicians of the Commonwealth in celebration of Oxford American Magazine’s 2017 Kentucky music issue. The evening will feature an eclectic lineup of Kentucky musicians and performers spanning genres from bluegrass to blues rock and everything in between. Each act will perform a handful of songs, paying tribute to the musical trailblazers that paved the way for Kentucky’s rich musical heritage.<br /><br />Featured artists for the evening are:<br /><br />Joan Shelley | http://www.joanshelley.net <br />Based out of Louisville, Kentucky, singer/songwriter Joan Shelley's warm and mellifluous voice evokes both the deep south and west coast, drawing from both old-time country and '60s folk. A talented songwriter and prolific performer, Shelley splits her time between solo outings and collaborations with other area musicians like Daniel Martin Moore and Joe Manning, with whom she issued the albums Farthest Field (2012) and Outside Stay Outside (2014), respectively, and with the old-timey music trio Maiden Radio, which also features the talents of Julia Purcell and Cheyenne Mize. Shelley released her solo debut Ginko in 2012, followed by the No Quarter-issued Electric Ursa in 2014, the latter of which saw her working alongside fleet-fingered guitarist Nathan Salsburg. 2015's Over and Even found Shelley and Salsburg delivering an evocative set of country-folk originals that flirted with English and Irish traditional music. For her eponymous fifth studio LP, Shelley, Salsburg, and James Elkington headed up to Chicago to record with Wilco's Jeff Tweedy behind the board.<br /><br />The Wooks | http://www.wookoutamerica.com<br />Energetically honoring the sound of traditional bluegrass and mountain music, with threads of singer-songwriter, rock and jam band music woven throughout, The Wooks are as at home on a festival stage as they are in a barn in the heart of Kentucky's horse country. The Wooks are CJ Cain (guitar), Galen Green (mandolin), Arthur Hancock (banjo), Roddy Puckett (bass) and Jesse Wells (fiddle). Inspired by legends and trailblazers like Crowe, Whitley, Simpson, Bush, Stapleton and Rice who cut their teeth on stages throughout the bluegrass region, The Wooks translate the sights and sounds of the people, hills, bars, roads and creeks around them into songs and shows that captivate. With both respect for their heritage and innovative originality, The Wooks are the natural evolution of a sound that has always been there.<br /><br />Jecorey “1200” Arthur | http://1200llc.com<br />1200’s performances are known for being uncategorizable, featuring something everyone will love. Whether performing as a DJ, full band or piano soloist, no genre is off the table. Jecorey \"1200\" Arthur is an award-winning educator, composer, performer and curator from Louisville, Kentucky. His performances range from Forecastle Festival to the 92nd Street Y Musical Introduction Series, to collaborations with the Louisville Orchestra, Indianapolis Symphony and Pittsburgh Symphony. Arthur dedicates his work to community as an event curator for City Collaborative, Speed Art Museum, Louisville Downtown Partnership and many more organizations. He is currently the music specialist at Hite Elementary where he teaches general music and directs performance ensembles. Through his 1200 performances, he is breaking down barriers in music education both on and off stage.<br /><br />Tee Dee Young | http://www.teedeeyoung.com<br />Tee Dee Young, a blues legend in his own time, definitely has the blues and loves “firing down on that guitar.” While playing his own unique style of the blues, his dynamic stage presence, exciting harmony and energy will put you in the mood for dancing. Young’s playing and singing are authentic to the genre but oblivious to current industry trends. His guitar is a weapon, wielded with total authority, assailing the listener with his sheer virtuosity. He writes and performs his own music, while covering music written by other artists. A native of Lexington, Kentucky, Young has been performing and playing for audiences for years and has opened up for and performed with legendary and acclaimed blues and R&B musicians such as Johnny Rawls, Guitar Shorty, Big Bill Morganfield, Albert King, Lil “Howling ” Wolf, Sir “Mack” Rice, Eddie Floyd, Malina Moye, Al Green, Denise LaSalle, Aretha Franklin, Cameo, Lakeside, James Brown, Alexander O’Neal, Vesta Williams, Miki Howard and many others. <br /><br />Brett Ratliff | http://brettratliff.net<br />Brett Ratliff's home place is Van Lear, Kentucky, the historic coal camp that gave birth to Loretta Lynn. Having been mentored by the masters of the area—George Gibson, Rich Kirby, Paul David Smith, Lee Sexton, and Jamie Wells among them—Ratliff is often the traditionally trained musician on stage with country, acid honk-a-tonk and cow punk. He has toured the region and the world with groups such as Clack Mountain String Band, Dirk Powell Band, Giant Rooster Sideshow and Rich & the Po’ Folk, and has played alongside the likes of Woody Pines, Chris Stapleton, Foghorn Stringband, Jean Ritchie, Mike Seeger and Art Stamper. Today Ratliff teaches traditional Kentucky repertoire at The Festival of American Fiddle Tunes in Port Townsend, Washington, Swannanoa Gathering in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Sore Fingers Week in Oxfordshire, England, Augusta Heritage's Early Country Music Week in Elkins, West Virginia, Cowan Creek Mountain Music School in Letcher County, Kentucky and elsewhere.<br /><br /><br />Johnny Conqueroo | http://www.johnnyconqueroo.com<br />Johnny Conqueroo is a highly kinetic blues/psych-rock trio from Lexington, Kentucky. Members include Grant Curless (guitar, vocals, keys), Wils Quinn (drums, vocals, percussion), and Shawn Reynolds (bass, keys). The band is touring in support of their second release, the new LP “Washed Up.\" After releasing their first EP in 2015, the band’s raw sound and energy drew the attention of local and regional audiences, with selection to play several 2016 festivals such as Moonshiners Ball, Beaux Arts Ball, Great Day, Moontower and Patchwork. As word spread, and EPs changed hands, eventually even Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Billy Gibbons took notice. Building on the momentum and grassroots support, Johnny Conqueroo released their genre bending LP “Washed Up” in December 2016, and is currently touring in support of “Washed Up”.",

The screening will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers moderated by Niles Center director emeritus, Ron Pen.<br /><br />An immersive meditation on the passage of time and the persistent resonance of place, Linefork follows the daily rituals of an elderly couple living in Kentucky's Appalachian Mountains. Now well into his eighties, Lee Sexton is the last living link to the distant past of a regional American music. A retired coal miner with black lung, Lee and his wife, Opal, continue to farm the land where he was born. Together they face encroaching health concerns and stark economic realities. Recorded over three years, Linefork is an observational film documenting their marriage, their community, their resilience, and the raw yet delicate music of an unheralded banjo legend, linked to the past yet immediately present.",

    "description":"<p>Please join us for the opening reception of Howard Finster: Prophecy on plywood.</p><p>Howard Finster produced over 46,000 works over the course of his lifetime,but his cutouts make up the bulk of his output. Cheap and reasonably weather resistant, plywood offered a flat surface that could endure the seasons, especially when covered in oil-based tractor enamel. When asked about the use of this particular paint, Finster declared it 'the best paint in the world.' He had painted his tractor with it and after years of heat and humidity, it'still look good.'</p><p>Howard Finster's artistic career developed alongside his activities as a preacher and work as a builder and handyman. His first combinations of words and images, called 'chalk work', came in the form of blackboard diagrams that he made while teaching Sunday school. Essential to Finster's visual language is his intermixing of biblical references and American pop culture. Henry Ford,Albert Einstein, Elvis Presley and other iconic celebrities are represented for their accomplishments that are 'biblical' in scale, appearing with archangels, dinosaurs, Siamese Twins, and Coca-Cola bottles. Finster saw the existence of these men and objects as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.</p><p>This exhibition was made possible in part thanks to a grant from Visit LEX.</p>",
